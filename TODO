TODO:
-- IMPORTANT:
  * optimize collision detection
  * de-magic statusbar

-- ASTEROIDS:
  * why do spawned asteroids sometimes immediately disappear? (because of moveUntilNotCollided)
    (should probably make sure that asteroids' vectors point toward the screen)
  * ensure minimum X and/or Y velocities for asteroids

-- BULLETS:
  * move bullet velocity stuff into bullet classes?
  * refactor BigBullet stuff, figure out what to do with that
  * get better BigBullet image

-- CONTROLS:
  * implement weapon switching once powerups exist
  * (A D?)

-- GAMEVIEW:
  * read screen size from size of canvas?
  * autoscale objects based on screen size?

-- GRAPHICS:
* powerup graphics
* asteroid destroy animation? (particle effects)
* ship destroy animation
* bullets should come from top of ship, not center
* do a better job of editing the shield graphics?

-- POWERUPS/WEAPONS:
* homing missiles
* multidirectional laser
* side ship / side weapon (sonic wave?)

FEATURES:
* bomb
* UFOs / enemy ships

DONE:
* make powerups stack (kill all other timeouts triggered by the same object)
* add powerup timeouts
* better bullet graphics
* shield (should make you bounce from asteroids?)
* powerups
* rapid fire
* better key handlers
* make sure asteroids don't spawn too close to the ship
* fix asteroid spawning distance issue
* remove all vector graphics stuff
* add image rotation
* restart game on collision
  * fix thing where asteroid passes through ship at start point
* asteroids should break when shot
* asteroids bounce off each other
* better ship graphics
* better asteroid graphics
* more waves
* remove magic numbers from screen size

BUGS:
* some errors that don't seem to matter
